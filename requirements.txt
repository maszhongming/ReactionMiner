# Transformers library (v4.34.0) still has a bug for left padding,
# and significantly affect the inference and thus our evaluation performance
# Follwing PR is a temporary fix for it but has not been merged yet.
# See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/25284
# But this PR is not compatible with the latest version of Transformers library (v4.34.0).
# To incorporate it, we forked the Transformers library and made some changes to make it compatible with the latest version.
