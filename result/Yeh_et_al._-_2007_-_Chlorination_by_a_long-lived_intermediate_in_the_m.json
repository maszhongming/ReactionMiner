The reaction of FADH2, Cl-, and O2 in the active site generates the powerful oxidant HOCl, which was presumed to carry out the chlorination reaction. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of a long-lived chlorinating intermediate (t1/2 ) 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) when RebH, FADH2, Cl-, and O2 react in the absence of substrate tryptophan. This intermediate remained on the enzyme after removal of FAD and transferred chlorine to tryptophan with kinetically competent rates. The identity of this intermediate is suggested by the X-ray crystal structure of RebH, which revealed an active site Lys79 located in a central position between flavin and tryptophan binding sites and just 4.1 \u00c5 above C7 of tryptophan. The chlorinating species is proposed to be a Lys-NoneNH-Cl (lysine chloramine) from reaction of enzyme-generated HOCl with the active site Lys79. This covalent enzyme chloramine likely plays a key role in directing regiospecific chlorination of substrate in this important class of biosynthetic enzymes. The modification of organic scaffolds by addition of halogen atoms is a prominent feature of many bioactive small molecules. Flavin-dependent halogenases are a major class of enzymes required for the biosynthesis of numerous halogenated natural products, including the antibiotics van-comycin and chloramphenicol as well as chemotherapeutic agent rebeccamycin. These enzymes catalyze the formation of carbon-halogen bonds at electron-rich carbon positions using FADH21 provided by a partner flavin reductase, halide ion (usually Cl-), and O2 (1). Insight into the chemical mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases has emerged both from the structure of the halogenase PrnA from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway and from kinetic characterization of RebH involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis (1, 2). PrnA and RebH share 55% sequence identity and, within their respective pathways, catalyze the identical overall reaction to chlorinate tryptophan at its C7 position (3, 4). The reaction of FADH2 and O2 in the active site generates a FAD(C4a)-OOH intermediate, which was detected during the RebH reaction (2). Both structural and kinetic evidence supports the subsequent formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the active site when FAD(C4a)-OOH is captured by Cl-(Scheme 1) (1, 2). It has been presumed that HOCl would then act as the proximal chlorinating agent, providing an electrophilic Cl+ equivalent to directly chlorinate the indole ring of tryptophan (1). A potent oxidant, HOCl reacts indiscriminately with many biological molecules, including the side chains of several protein residues. To fulfill its proposed function as the chlorinating agent in the active site of flavin halogenases, it would need to be protected from other reactive functionalities in these enzymes and quickly and specifically consumed in the substrate chlorination reaction. However, two observa-tions from the RebH reaction kinetics and the PrnA structure seemed to challenge these assumptions. First, during stopped-flow studies to monitor formation of flavin intermediates in RebH, flavin reactions leading to HOCl production were observed with or without L-Trp present, suggesting that this potent oxidant is formed in the active site without available substrate for reaction (2). Second, in the PrnA structure, an active site Lys79 residue is located adjacent to the bound tryptophan (1). Studies of protein oxidation by HOCl show that the NoneNH2 of lysine reacts rapidly with HOCl to form a long-lived chloramine, Lys-NoneNH-Cl (t1/2 > 25 h) (5, 6). Chloramines can also carry out chlorination reactions, albeit with reduced reactivity compared to HOCl (7-9), and may play a role in the flavin halogenase mechanism (2, 10, 11). These observations led us to ask whether HOCl itself or the stable product of an enzyme reaction with HOCl might persist in the active site if flavin reactions were carried out \u2020 This work was supported in part by NIH Grants GM 69857 (C.L.D.) and GM 49338 (C.T.W.), a T32-GM 08334 Training Grant (L.C.B.), and a NIH Medical Scientist Training Fellowship (E.Y.).

Furthermore, would such a stable species in the active site still be competent for reaction once substrate was added? In the following study, we describe the formation of a long-lived intermediate in the RebH active site when the reaction of FADH2, Cl-, and O2 was catalyzed in the absence of tryptophan. Upon addition of tryptophan, this stable species carried out the chlorination reaction with kinetically competent rates, suggesting that this enzyme-chlorinating species is an important intermediate on the normal reaction pathway. In the crystal structure of RebH with bound flavin and tryptophan solved at 2.1 \u00c5, Lys79 occupies a key position between the binding pockets for flavin and substrate tryptophan. Furthermore, the structure of the apoenzyme reveals an open active site, unsuitable for protection of a reactive HOCl. On the basis of the extended half-life of the intermediate (t1/2 ) 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) as well as the central position of Lys79 in the RebH structure, we propose that the chlorinating intermediate exists as a stable covalent Lys79-NoneNH-Cl, the proximal chlorinating agent in the chemical mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression Constructs and Protein OVerproduction. Con-struction of pET28a RebH and preparation of N-His6-RebH was previously reported (4). Site-directed mutagenesis of pET28a RebH was performed by overlap extension using primers from previous cloning of RebH (4) and primers containing mutations to introduce the amino acid change (bold) and an NheI site, 5\u2032-GCGGGAGTGCAACGCTAGC-TACGCGGTCGCCATCAAGTTC-3\u2032 (K79A) and 5\u2032-GCGG-GAGTGCAACGCTAGCTACATGGTCGCCATCAAGTTC-3\u2032 (K79M). Fragments containing the desired mutation were cloned into NdeI/HindIII sites of pET28a. Enzyme variants were overexpressed and purified using the same procedure as for the wild-type enzyme (4). Product Formation Assays for Intermediate Detection. Reactions were performed as described (2) by mixing equal volumes of FADH2 solution and oxygenated solution con-taining RebH and NaCl. After 10 min incubation, flavin was removed by a desalting step on a Bio-Rad P-6DG column. L-[14C]Tryptophan (Perkin-Elmer; 53 Ci/mol) was added in a separate reaction. Protein was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 5%). Reaction products were separated on silica-C18 TLC (Aldrich) in 10% acetonitrile/90% H2O and detected by storage phosphor autoradiography (2). To determine the product formation rate, enzyme containing the chlorinating intermediate was purified on large scale following reaction with FADH2, NaCl, and O2. Reactions were initiated by addition of L-[14C]Trp and quenched between 3 and 1200 s. The product yield was plotted against time, and the data were fitted to an expo-nential equation to derive the rate constant for 7-chlorot-ryptophan formation. 36Cl Labeling of the Reaction Intermediate and Products. Equal volumes of FADH2 solution and oxygenated solution containing RebH and [36Cl]NaCl (0.5 Ci/mol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were mixed as described (2). The protein was purified by desalting on a Bio-Rad P-6DG column to remove flavin and excess [36Cl]NaCl. If indicated, L-tryptophan was added. The reaction was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a silica-based Bio-Sep SEC-S 300 column (Phenomenex) in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer (native conditions) or with addition of 0.5% SDS or 6 M urea (denaturing conditions). A Beckman System Gold HPLC instrument with an in-line IN/US \u00e2-RAM 3 radiodetector was used. A standard curve of the radioactivity detected with different amounts of [36Cl]NaCl was calculated and used to quantify the amount of 36Cl label on the protein. Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals of apo-RebH appeared within 48 h using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 \u00b0C. Apo-RebH (2 \u00b5L of 8 mg mL-1 in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (1.2 M sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring to reservoir solution augmented with 10%, 20%, and then 30% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain the Trp-bound RebH structure, crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 5 mM FAD, 5 mM NaCl, and saturating L-tryptophan. They were cryoprotected in this soaking solution augmented with 10%, 20%, and 30% glycerol. FAD was clearly present in this structure but was too disordered to model. To attempt to generate the chlorinating intermediate in the crystal, crystals of apo-RebH were soaked in anaerobic reservoir solution with 10 mM FADH2 and 3 mM NaCl, and the FADH2 was allowed to oxidize to FAD. This soak was repeated with 10%, 20%, and 30% glycerol, and then the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The resulting structure is referred to here as FAD-RebH. Native data sets for apo-RebH and Trp-RebH were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL) beamline 9-1, and the FAD-RebH data set was collected at SSRL beamline 9-2. All data were collected at a wavelength of 0.98 \u00c5 and at a temperature of 100 K. Data were processed and scaled in HKL2000 (12). The crystals belonged to the spacegroup P62 with two RebH molecules per asymmetric unit. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of apo-RebH was solved by molecular replacement with data to 3.0 \u00c5 resolution using the CCP4 (13) program PHASER (14) and the structure of PrnA (2AQJ) as a search model. PrnA has 54% identity and 82% homology with RebH. The top solution gave a Z-score of 57.0. The model was built Scheme 1: Generation of HOCl in the Active Site of Flavin-Dependent Halogenases using Xfit (15) and Coot (16) and refined in CNS (17). The Trp-RebH and FAD-RebH structures were solved by rigid body refinement using the apo-RebH model. The same set of test reflections (extended for higher resolution structures) was used to calculate Rfree for all models. Simulated annealing composite omit maps calculated in CNS were used to verify structures throughout refinement. The final model of apo-RebH contains residues 2-528 out of 530 with one chain break per molecule (from residue 451 to residue 454). In the Trp-RebH structure, residues 2-528 were observed in the electron density. The FAD-RebH structure contains residues 2-528 with one chain break (residue 451 to residue 452 in chain B). The B-factors for the FAD in this structure are higher than those of the surrounding protein, indicating that the FAD is not present at full occupancy. This is unsurprising given that the natural substrate of RebH is FADH2. The topology and parameter files for FAD were obtained from the HIC-Up server (18). A summary of the final refinement statistics is available in Supporting Informa-tion, Table 1. Assessment of the models in PROCHECK (19) revealed no unfavorable geometries, with 90.3%, 90.8%, and 89.7% of the residues in the \u201cmost favored\u201d conformation for the apo-RebH, Trp-RebH, and Fad-RebH structures, respectively. Figures were generated in PyMOL (20). RESULTS Formation of a Chlorinating Species. The overall reaction of RebH to form 7-chlorotryptophan during the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin is shown in Figure 1A. Formation of 7-chlorotryptophan by RebH was previously demonstrated in single-turnover assays (2) by mixing enzyme, NaCl, and L-[14C]tryptophan in oxygenated buffer with an anaerobic solution of FADH2 (Figure 1B, lane 1). To detect the formation of a stable enzyme species following flavin reactions, product formation was again monitored by single-turnover assays, except that enzyme was first reacted with FADH2, Cl-, and O2 in the absence of L-tryptophan. The reaction was complete when colorless FADH2 was fully oxidized to yellow FAD. The enzyme was isolated on a desalting column, resulting in nearly complete removal of FAD, and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min. L-[14C]Trp was then added in a second reaction. Reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and analyzed by storage phosphor autoradiography. The yield of 7-chloro-tryptophan by this procedure was 70% (ratio of enzyme to L-[14C]Trp ) 1; Figure 1B, lane 3) and comparable to the reaction in which enzyme, substrate, and reactants were combined in a single step (lane 1). By monitoring the incorporation of radioactive 36Cl into the enzyme, it was determined that the detected enzyme species contains radioactivity derived from Cl-, consistent with its activity to chlorinate the substrate. The initial flavin reactions were performed as described above, substituting [36Cl]NaCl as the source of Cl-. Protein and small molecule components of the reaction were then separated by silica-based size exclusion chromatography, and each fraction was monitored for radioactivity. Incorporation of 0.6 equiv of 36Cl was observed on the enzyme following the flavin reactions (Figure 1C, trace 2). Upon addition of L-Trp, 36Cl label from the enzyme appeared in new peak corresponding to 7-[36Cl]chlorotryptophan (trace 3). Notably, 36Cl labeling of the enzyme was lost when reactions were analyzed under denaturing conditions using 0.5% SDS or 6.0 M urea. Taken together, these results demonstrate the formation of an enzyme-chlorinating species during the reaction of RebH with FADH2, Cl-, and O2. This species remains on the enzyme after removal of FAD and is fully competent to transfer chlorine to L-Trp in a second reaction forming 7-chlorotryptophan product. Neither product formation nor 36Cl labeling of the enzyme was detected in control reactions when RebH was initially reacted with oxidized FAD (Figure 1B, lane 2, and Figure 1C, trace 1). The enzyme variants, K79A (Figure 1B, lane 4, and Figure 1C, trace 4) and K79M (data not shown), were also inactive in both product formation and enzyme labeling assays. The species formed in the active site may be tightly bound or a covalent modification of the protein but is either released or labile upon denaturation of the enzyme. Product formation and 36Cl labeling assays also indicate formation of a stable chlorinating species in the flavin-dependent halogenase PltA, which catalyzes the dichlorina-tion of a pyrrole ring presented on a carrier protein scaffold during biosynthesis of pyoluteorin (21) (see Supporting Information, Figure 1). Curiously, PltM, another halogenase found in the pyoluteorin gene cluster but whose function in the biosynthetic pathway is unknown, also reacts with FADH2, [36Cl]NaCl, and O2 to form the enzyme containing the 36Cl label. Because of the difficulty of accessing substrate in this system and lack of kinetic information, we did not carry out further characterization of the chlorinating species in these enzymes. However, the identity of the intermediate is likely the same as in RebH. Table 1: Data Collection and Refinement Statistics (Molecular Stability of the Chlorinating Species in the ActiVe Site. During experiments to detect the chlorinating species in RebH, we noted above that the species was sufficiently stable to allow isolation of the enzyme and incubation at 25 \u00b0C before carrying out the substrate chlorination reaction. The half-life of decay of the chlorinating species was determined by monitoring its substrate chlorination activity from 0 to 288 h following its formation. Loss of substrate-chlorinating activity was attributed to decay of the species in the active site. This analysis showed that the chlorinating species is remarkably long-lived with t1/2 of 63 h at 4 \u00b0C and 28 h at 25 \u00b0C (Figure 2A). The stability of the enzyme-associated intermediate suggests that, once formed, it can remain in the active site for an extended time until substrate becomes available for reaction. RebH can also catalyze bromination of tryptophan by substituting Cl-with Br-when NaBr is present in solution (4). The t1/2 of the corresponding brominating species was approximately 60 min at 4 \u00b0C. The brominating species may have lower intrinsic chemical stability. Alternatively, the active site may not be as well-suited for protection of the brominated analogue. I-was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the RebH reaction in steady-state assays (see Supporting Information, Figure 2). In particular, I-completely inhibits formation of the chlorinating species when present in solution during flavin reactions. The addition of I-after flavin reactions also increased the rate of decay of the chlorinating species by >200-fold such that complete loss of activity was noted within 20 min of NaI treatment (see Supporting Information, Figure 2). Thus, I-is able to access and eliminate the species in the active site once it is formed. Kinetic Characterization of a Reaction Intermediate. The activity of the detected enzyme-chlorinating species to form the 7-chlorotryptophan product suggests that it is a critical intermediate in the enzymatic mechanism, rather than the product of an off-pathway side reaction. We determined the product formation rate for the active site chlorinating species to establish its kinetic competence as a reaction intermediate. RebH was first reacted with FADH2, Cl-, and O2 to isolate enzyme with the chlorinating species preformed in the active site. L-[14C]Trp was then added to the isolated enzyme sample, and the reaction was quenched at time points from 0 to 1800 s. The rate of 7-chlorotryptophan formation by the enzyme-chlorinating species was 0.29 s-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.17 s-1 at 4 \u00b0C (Figure 2B). These rates were compared with those obtained previously for the RebH reaction, specifically those for flavin reactions generating HOCl and overall product formation (2) (Figure 2C). In the reaction in which RebH is reacted with FADH2, Cl-, O2, and tryptophan, the rate of 7-chlorotryptophan formation was 0.05 s-1 at 25 \u00b0C (0.009 s-1 at 4 \u00b0C). This overall reaction rate corresponds to the steady-state kcat value and the rate-determining slow step in the mechanism (2, 4). Any individual step in the mechanism (and any intermediate that catalyzes this step) must proceed at a rate equal to or faster than this slowest rate. The detected chlorinating species in RebH catalyzes product formation at a rate significantly faster than in the overall reaction (6-fold increase at 25 \u00b0C and 20-fold increase at 4 \u00b0C) and, therefore, is a kinetically competent intermediate on the RebH reaction pathway. Indeed, it likely represents the proximal chlorinating agent in the active site which reacts directly with the substrate. FIGURE 1: Detection of a stable chlorinating intermediate in RebH. (A) Formation of 7-chlorotryptophan by RebH as the initial step in Furthermore, the observation that both flavin reactions forming HOCl and product formation by the chlorinating intermediate are fast implies that the rate-determining step in the reaction is likely to be the formation of this chlorinat-ing intermediate. Central Position of an ActiVe Site Lysine. We solved the structure of apo-RebH and of enzyme with bound FAD or tryptophan to obtain structural evidence for the identity of the chlorinating intermediate formed in the RebH active site. The structure of PrnA, which shares 55% sequence identity with RebH, was previously determined (1). As expected, in the overall fold and binding of flavin and tryptophan, RebH closely resembles PrnA with an rmsd of 0.99 \u00c5 for superimposition of the R carbons of 483 residues (see Supporting Information, Figure 3). Though we were unable to obtain a structure of the enzyme containing the actual chlorinating intermediate, the apo, tryptophan-bound, and flavin-bound RebH structures were evaluated in light of the new evidence for formation of a stable chlorinating inter-mediate in the active site. A key finding from the structure of halogenase PrnA was that flavin and tryptophan are separated by over 10 \u00c5 in the active site (1). It was concluded that HOCl generated in the flavin binding site would have to traverse this distance in order to catalyze the chlorination of tryptophan. Residue K79 in PrnA was highlighted as having a potential role in orientation of HOCl within the active site. We were also intrigued by the key position of K79 in the RebH structure (corresponding to the same residue in PrnA). In both PrnA and RebH, K79 is located directly between the flavin and tryptophan binding sites. Using the program CASTp3 and a standard probe size of 1.4 \u00c5, we searched for cavities in the tryptophan-bound RebH structure. This analysis showed that flavin and tryptophan bind in two separate cavities and that there is no open pathway between the two binding sites (Figure 3a). In fact, it would appear that HOCl generated in the flavin binding site would first encounter K79 before it could access the Trp binding pocket. In studies of protein oxidation, HOCl reacts readily with the NoneNH2 of lysine (k ) 7900 M-1 s-1) to form a stable chloramine, Lys-NoneNH-Cl (5, 6). Notably, the side chain of K79 is ordered, and its position and interactions are conserved in all of the structures solved thus far of RebH and PrnA. In both enzymes, K79 sits just 4.1 \u00c5 from C7 of tryptophan and forms a tight hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl of S347 (Figure 3b and Supporting Information, Figure 4). This interaction may be critical to the overall structure of the enzyme, as RebH K79A and K79M variants are affected in flavin oxidation reactions as well as overall halogenation activity (data not shown). Therefore, residue K79 occupies a key position in the RebH (and PrnA) active site and is a potential site for covalent modification by HOCl. An alternative to the formation of a lysine chloramine as the chlorinating intermediate is the sequestration of a small FIGURE 2: Kinetic characterization of the chlorinating intermediate. (A) Decay of the chlorinating intermediate was monitored by incubating molecule, HOCl, in the active site to carry out the chlorina-tion reaction. Since the form of the enzyme that contains the chlorinating intermediate does not require either bound FAD or L-Trp, we compared the structure of apo-RebH to that of PrnA containing both FAD and tryptophan to assess the potential for a small-molecule binding pocket in the apoenzyme. Notably, when flavin and tryptophan binding sites are unoccupied, the active site becomes exposed to solvent. A loop comprised of residues 40-49 is shifted 6 \u00c5 away from the opening of the flavin binding site, allowing solvent access to the entire flavin binding pocket (Figure 3c and Supporting Information, Figure 3). Residues 468-475 also become disordered, allowing both substrate and solvent access to the tryptophan binding site (see Supporting Information, Figure 3). Thus, in the active site of the apo-RebH structure, we were unable to identify a binding pocket that could protect a small-molecule intermediate, particularly one as reactive as HOCl. Moreover, addition of tryptophan to the FAD-bound enzyme also causes FAD to become disordered, so that the flavin binding site becomes exposed when substrate is in position to react. Lacking a covalent attachment, the available structures suggest that it would be exceedingly difficult to retain a chlorinating agent in the active site. DISCUSSION HOCl generated from capture of FAD(C4a)-OOH by Cl-during flavin redox reactions (1, 2) was previously proposed to function as the chlorinating agent that reacts directly with bound substrate during the halogenase reaction (1) (Scheme 1). This mechanism now appears unlikely given the remark-able stability of the enzyme-bound chlorinating intermediate detected in RebH (t1/2 ) 63 h or 2.6 days at 4 \u00b0C). It seems highly improbable that HOCl could be sequestered within the active site for such an extended time (up to 2 days) to prevent its diffusion away from the enzyme and reaction with other biological molecules. In the RebH structure and previously reported PrnA structure (1), no binding site for protection of such a reactive intermediate could be identified. In fact, the RebH active site becomes relatively exposed to solvent when flavin and tryptophan are absent. The ability of I-to access the chlorinating intermediate in RebH and accelerate its decomposition also suggests that the active site which contains this intermediate is solvent-accessible and unlikely to harbor a noncovalently associated, reactive small molecule. Rather, the RebH structure and closely related PrnA structure (1) show Lys79 located between the binding pockets for FAD and tryptophan in the active site. In this arrange-ment, HOCl generated from flavin redox reactions would encounter this lysine residue before reaching the substrate tryptophan. We propose that HOCl reacts with the active site lysine to form a stable chloramine. Indeed, the stability of the detected active site chlorinating species (t1/2 ) 28 h at 25 \u00b0C and 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) is consistent with that of Lys-NoneNH-Cl, which has t1/2 > 25 h at 37 \u00b0C (5, 22). As a covalently bound lysine chloramine, the chlorinating inter-mediate can be tethered via the N-Cl bond in the active site for prolonged periods. Neither HOCl nor an enzyme chloramine is expected to be stable in the unfolded enzyme as both react readily with Met and Cys residues that become exposed upon protein denaturation. Similarly, both are decomposed upon reaction with I-. FIGURE 3: Structure of RebH. (a) The ribbon structure of RebH Unfortunately, attempts to characterize this intermediate by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry were unsuccessful. Although the apoenzyme crystallized in 2 days at 4 \u00b0C, crystallization of the intermediate form of the enzyme required 2 weeks, by which time all of the intermediate had decayed. Conformational dynamics which occur during the flavin reactions may also prevent in situ generation of the chlorinating intermediate, as it could not be detected in the crystal of the apoenzyme following soaking with FADH2. A distinct chemical shift change of the NoneC of lysine is associated with formation of free lysine chloramine, but we were unable to observe the same change by 13C-HSQC or direct 13C detection of enzyme containing lysine-specific labeling. The sensitivity by NMR may be limited by the large size of the enzyme, which likely exists as the dimer (120 kDa). Finally, the decay of the intermediate upon protein denaturation precluded proteolytic digestion and detection of modified protein fragments by mass spectrometry. Despite the lack of direct detection of the proposed enzyme chloramine intermediate, the biochemical and structural evidence presented herein provides a basis for proposal of the following mechanism with Lys-NoneNH-Cl as the proximal chlorinating agent. As shown in Scheme 2, HOCl is formed as a product of flavin-based redox reactions and reacts with the active site lysine to form Lys-NoneNH-Cl. In the RebH structure, the NoneN of Lys79 sits 4.1 \u00c5 away from C7 of tryptophan (1). Thus, a Lys79-NoneNH-Cl may be ideally oriented for delivering a Cl+ equivalent for electrophilic aromatic substitution of the indole ring at C7. A candidate lysine corresponding to Lys79 can be identified in other known flavin-dependent halogenases (see Supporting Infor-mation, Figure 5). Furthermore, a similar chlorinating species has also been detected in the halogenase PltA and PltM from pyoluteorin biosynthesis (21) (see Supporting Information, Figure 1). Hence, we anticipate that formation of an enzyme chloramine intermediate will be a common feature in the mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases. The available kinetic data for RebH suggest that formation of this chlorinating intermediate is the rate-limiting step (Figure 2C). Because the chemical reaction between HOCl and lysine to form Lys-NoneNH-Cl is fast (8), the slow rate could be attributed to protein conformational changes that occur upon formation of this covalent enzyme intermediate. Protein dynamics was already shown to be critical for formation of flavin intermediates in RebH (2), and structural changes in the enzyme following formation of the chlorinating inter-mediate are indicated by NMR studies (data not shown). Notably, the KD for tryptophan in the unreacted enzyme was >100 \u00b5M as determined by equilibrium dialysis and ultra-filtration (data not shown) despite a steady-state Km value of 2.0 \u00b5M (4). Structural changes following intermediate formation could increase the affinity of the enzyme (now in the reactive form) for the substrate. In this way, substrate tryptophan only binds to the enzyme once the chlorinating intermediate is formed and the active site is set up for the chlorination reaction, possibly to prevent inappropriate reaction of substrate with HOCl that is also generated in the active site. The sequence of reactions proposed in the halogenase active site has precedent in protein oxidation carried out by HOCl and its chloramine products during the inflammatory response. Myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl is released by neutrophils and macrophages as a chemical weapon against invading microbes, where oxidative damage to cellular proteins leads to cell death. In addition to direct rapid oxidation by HOCl, chloramine products formed from the reaction of HOCl with biological amines have been shown to be important secondary mediators of further oxidative reactions (23, 24). The relatively stable chloramines remain active long after the initial immune response and can also diffuse away from the local site to inflict oxidative damage. As oxidizing agents, chloramines are milder and more selective for their target (7, 23), since their reactivity can be influenced by local structure and environment. Following HOCl treatment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), formation of a chloramine on an adjacent lysine directs chlorination of a specific Tyr192 residue in HDL (25-27). Chlorination of a catalytic Tyr in D-amino acid oxidase also requires specific binding of D-amino acid chloramine but does not occur with L-amino acid derivatives (28, 29). In this biological setting, the stability and selectivity of chloramines distinguish them from more potent and indiscriminate HOCl. The conversion of HOCl to a covalent chloramine in the active site of flavin-dependent halogenases offers distinct advantages for carrying out the regiospecific halogenation of small molecules for natural product construction. First, the oxidative potential of reactive HOCl is stored in a long-lived chloramine intermediate that is primed to react upon availabilityofthesubstrate.Becausereactionswithmonochloram-ines RNHCl are typically 105 slower compared with HOCl (7-9), precise tuning of the reactivity of the chloramine intermediate must occur in the active site in order to provide the oxidative potential required for chlorination of substrates such as tryptophan. Both the protonated monochloramine RNH2Cl+ (pKa \u223c1.5) and dichloramine RNCl2 (stable at pH <5) are more reactive, though significant perturbation of the local protein environment would be required to stabilize these forms of the intermediate at physiologic pH (22, 30-32). Efficient delivery of a Cl+ equivalent may also be facilitated Scheme 2: Proposed Mechanism of RebH (PrnA) with by presentation of the substrate in optimal orientation and van der Waals distance from the N-Cl bond. Second, covalent catalysis by a reactive modification on a protein side chain provides for substrate and regiospecificity essential to the reaction by facilitating the orientation of substrate to the chloramine. This precise arrangement may be especially important since C7 is not the most activated position for nucleophilic substitution on the indole ring. Orientation effects may also explain the regiospecificity of halogenases that chlorinate at C5 or C6, rather than C7 (33, 34). In contrast, perhydrolases and haloperoxidases that generate free HOCl lack the specificity required for utility in biosynthetic reactions (35-39). Detection of the long-lived chlorinating intermediate in the flavin-dependent halogenase mechanism suggests nature\u2019s ingenious solution to the chemical problem of controlling a reactive and potentially destructive oxidant, HOCl, for C-Cl bond construction.

        "ABSTRACT: The flavin-dependent halogenase RebH catalyzes the formation of 7-chlorotryptophan as the initial step in the biosynthesis of antitumor agent rebeccamycin. The reaction of FADH2, Cl-, and O2 in the active site generates the powerful oxidant HOCl, which was presumed to carry out the chlorination reaction. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of a long-lived chlorinating intermediate (t1/2 ) 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) when RebH, FADH2, Cl-, and O2 react in the absence of substrate tryptophan. This intermediate remained on the enzyme after removal of FAD and transferred chlorine to tryptophan with kinetically competent rates. The identity of this intermediate is suggested by the X-ray crystal structure of RebH, which revealed an active site Lys79 located in a central position between flavin and tryptophan binding sites and just 4.1 \u00c5 above C7 of tryptophan. The chlorinating species is proposed to be a Lys-NoneNH-Cl (lysine chloramine) from reaction of enzyme-generated HOCl with the active site Lys79. This covalent enzyme chloramine likely plays a key role in directing regiospecific chlorination of substrate in this important class of biosynthetic enzymes.",
        "The modification of organic scaffolds by addition of halogen atoms is a prominent feature of many bioactive small molecules. Flavin-dependent halogenases are a major class of enzymes required for the biosynthesis of numerous halogenated natural products, including the antibiotics van-comycin and chloramphenicol as well as chemotherapeutic agent rebeccamycin. These enzymes catalyze the formation of carbon-halogen bonds at electron-rich carbon positions using FADH21 provided by a partner flavin reductase, halide ion (usually Cl-), and O2 (1).",
        "Insight into the chemical mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases has emerged both from the structure of the halogenase PrnA from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway and from kinetic characterization of RebH involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis (1, 2). PrnA and RebH share 55% sequence identity and, within their respective pathways, catalyze the identical overall reaction to chlorinate tryptophan at its C7 position (3, 4). The reaction of FADH2 and O2 in the active site generates a FAD(C4a)-OOH intermediate, which was detected during the RebH reaction (2). Both structural and kinetic evidence supports the subsequent formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the active site when FAD(C4a)-OOH is captured by Cl-(Scheme 1) (1, 2). It has been presumed that HOCl would then act as the proximal chlorinating agent, providing an electrophilic Cl+ equivalent to directly chlorinate the indole ring of tryptophan (1).",
        "A potent oxidant, HOCl reacts indiscriminately with many biological molecules, including the side chains of several protein residues. To fulfill its proposed function as the chlorinating agent in the active site of flavin halogenases, it would need to be protected from other reactive functionalities in these enzymes and quickly and specifically consumed in the substrate chlorination reaction. However, two observa-tions from the RebH reaction kinetics and the PrnA structure seemed to challenge these assumptions. First, during stopped-flow studies to monitor formation of flavin intermediates in RebH, flavin reactions leading to HOCl production were observed with or without L-Trp present, suggesting that this potent oxidant is formed in the active site without available substrate for reaction (2). Second, in the PrnA structure, an active site Lys79 residue is located adjacent to the bound tryptophan (1). Studies of protein oxidation by HOCl show that the NoneNH2 of lysine reacts rapidly with HOCl to form a long-lived chloramine, Lys-NoneNH-Cl (t1/2 > 25 h) (5, 6). Chloramines can also carry out chlorination reactions, albeit with reduced reactivity compared to HOCl (7-9), and may play a role in the flavin halogenase mechanism (2, 10, 11). These observations led us to ask whether HOCl itself or the stable product of an enzyme reaction with HOCl might persist in the active site if flavin reactions were carried out",

        "in the absence of substrate. Furthermore, would such a stable species in the active site still be competent for reaction once substrate was added?",
        "In the following study, we describe the formation of a long-lived intermediate in the RebH active site when the reaction of FADH2, Cl-, and O2 was catalyzed in the absence of tryptophan. Upon addition of tryptophan, this stable species carried out the chlorination reaction with kinetically competent rates, suggesting that this enzyme-chlorinating species is an important intermediate on the normal reaction pathway. In the crystal structure of RebH with bound flavin and tryptophan solved at 2.1 \u00c5, Lys79 occupies a key position between the binding pockets for flavin and substrate tryptophan. Furthermore, the structure of the apoenzyme reveals an open active site, unsuitable for protection of a reactive HOCl. On the basis of the extended half-life of the intermediate (t1/2 ) 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) as well as the central position of Lys79 in the RebH structure, we propose that the chlorinating intermediate exists as a stable covalent Lys79-NoneNH-Cl, the proximal chlorinating agent in the chemical mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES",
        "Expression Constructs and Protein OVerproduction. Con-struction of pET28a RebH and preparation of N-His6-RebH was previously reported (4). Site-directed mutagenesis of pET28a RebH was performed by overlap extension using primers from previous cloning of RebH (4) and primers containing mutations to introduce the amino acid change (bold) and an NheI site, 5\u2032-GCGGGAGTGCAACGCTAGC-TACGCGGTCGCCATCAAGTTC-3\u2032 (K79A) and 5\u2032-GCGG-GAGTGCAACGCTAGCTACATGGTCGCCATCAAGTTC-3\u2032 (K79M). Fragments containing the desired mutation were cloned into NdeI/HindIII sites of pET28a. Enzyme variants were overexpressed and purified using the same procedure as for the wild-type enzyme (4).",
        "Product Formation Assays for Intermediate Detection. Reactions were performed as described (2) by mixing equal volumes of FADH2 solution and oxygenated solution con-taining RebH and NaCl. After 10 min incubation, flavin was removed by a desalting step on a Bio-Rad P-6DG column. L-[14C]Tryptophan (Perkin-Elmer; 53 Ci/mol) was added in a separate reaction. Protein was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 5%). Reaction products were separated on silica-C18 TLC (Aldrich) in 10% acetonitrile/90% H2O and detected by storage phosphor autoradiography (2). To determine the product formation rate, enzyme containing the chlorinating intermediate was purified on large scale following reaction with FADH2, NaCl, and O2. Reactions were initiated by addition of L-[14C]Trp and quenched between 3 and 1200 s. The product yield was plotted against time, and the data were fitted to an expo-nential equation to derive the rate constant for 7-chlorot-ryptophan formation.",
        "36Cl Labeling of the Reaction Intermediate and Products. Equal volumes of FADH2 solution and oxygenated solution containing RebH and [36Cl]NaCl (0.5 Ci/mol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were mixed as described (2). The protein was purified by desalting on a Bio-Rad P-6DG column to remove flavin and excess [36Cl]NaCl. If indicated, L-tryptophan was added. The reaction was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a silica-based Bio-Sep SEC-S 300 column (Phenomenex) in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer (native conditions) or with addition of 0.5% SDS or 6 M urea (denaturing conditions). A Beckman System Gold HPLC instrument with an in-line IN/US \u00e2-RAM 3 radiodetector was used. A standard curve of the radioactivity detected with different amounts of [36Cl]NaCl was calculated and used to quantify the amount of 36Cl label on the protein.",
        "Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals of apo-RebH appeared within 48 h using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 \u00b0C. Apo-RebH (2 \u00b5L of 8 mg mL-1 in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (1.2 M sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring to reservoir solution augmented with 10%, 20%, and then 30% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain the Trp-bound RebH structure, crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 5 mM FAD, 5 mM NaCl, and saturating L-tryptophan. They were cryoprotected in this soaking solution augmented with 10%, 20%, and 30% glycerol. FAD was clearly present in this structure but was too disordered to model. To attempt to generate the chlorinating intermediate in the crystal, crystals of apo-RebH were soaked in anaerobic reservoir solution with 10 mM FADH2 and 3 mM NaCl, and the FADH2 was allowed to oxidize to FAD. This soak was repeated with 10%, 20%, and 30% glycerol, and then the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The resulting structure is referred to here as FAD-RebH.",
        "Native data sets for apo-RebH and Trp-RebH were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL) beamline 9-1, and the FAD-RebH data set was collected at SSRL beamline 9-2. All data were collected at a wavelength of 0.98 \u00c5 and at a temperature of 100 K. Data were processed and scaled in HKL2000 (12). The crystals belonged to the spacegroup P62 with two RebH molecules per asymmetric unit. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of apo-RebH was solved by molecular replacement with data to 3.0 \u00c5 resolution using the CCP4 (13) program PHASER (14) and the structure of PrnA (2AQJ) as a search model. PrnA has 54% identity and 82% homology with RebH. The top solution gave a Z-score of 57.0. The model was built",

        "using Xfit (15) and Coot (16) and refined in CNS (17). The Trp-RebH and FAD-RebH structures were solved by rigid body refinement using the apo-RebH model. The same set of test reflections (extended for higher resolution structures) was used to calculate Rfree for all models. Simulated annealing composite omit maps calculated in CNS were used to verify structures throughout refinement. The final model of apo-RebH contains residues 2-528 out of 530 with one chain break per molecule (from residue 451 to residue 454). In the Trp-RebH structure, residues 2-528 were observed in the electron density. The FAD-RebH structure contains residues 2-528 with one chain break (residue 451 to residue 452 in chain B). The B-factors for the FAD in this structure are higher than those of the surrounding protein, indicating that the FAD is not present at full occupancy. This is unsurprising given that the natural substrate of RebH is FADH2. The topology and parameter files for FAD were obtained from the HIC-Up server (18). A summary of the final refinement statistics is available in Supporting Informa-tion, Table 1. Assessment of the models in PROCHECK (19) revealed no unfavorable geometries, with 90.3%, 90.8%, and 89.7% of the residues in the \u201cmost favored\u201d conformation for the apo-RebH, Trp-RebH, and Fad-RebH structures, respectively. Figures were generated in PyMOL (20).",
        "RESULTS",
        "Formation of a Chlorinating Species. The overall reaction of RebH to form 7-chlorotryptophan during the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin is shown in Figure 1A. Formation of 7-chlorotryptophan by RebH was previously demonstrated in single-turnover assays (2) by mixing enzyme, NaCl, and L-[14C]tryptophan in oxygenated buffer with an anaerobic solution of FADH2 (Figure 1B, lane 1). To detect the formation of a stable enzyme species following flavin reactions, product formation was again monitored by single-turnover assays, except that enzyme was first reacted with FADH2, Cl-, and O2 in the absence of L-tryptophan. The reaction was complete when colorless FADH2 was fully oxidized to yellow FAD. The enzyme was isolated on a desalting column, resulting in nearly complete removal of FAD, and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min. L-[14C]Trp was then added in a second reaction. Reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and analyzed by storage phosphor autoradiography. The yield of 7-chloro-tryptophan by this procedure was 70% (ratio of enzyme to L-[14C]Trp ) 1; Figure 1B, lane 3) and comparable to the reaction in which enzyme, substrate, and reactants were combined in a single step (lane 1).",
        "By monitoring the incorporation of radioactive 36Cl into the enzyme, it was determined that the detected enzyme species contains radioactivity derived from Cl-, consistent with its activity to chlorinate the substrate. The initial flavin reactions were performed as described above, substituting [36Cl]NaCl as the source of Cl-. Protein and small molecule components of the reaction were then separated by silica-based size exclusion chromatography, and each fraction was monitored for radioactivity. Incorporation of 0.6 equiv of 36Cl was observed on the enzyme following the flavin reactions (Figure 1C, trace 2). Upon addition of L-Trp, 36Cl label from the enzyme appeared in new peak corresponding to 7-[36Cl]chlorotryptophan (trace 3). Notably, 36Cl labeling of the enzyme was lost when reactions were analyzed under denaturing conditions using 0.5% SDS or 6.0 M urea.",
        "Taken together, these results demonstrate the formation of an enzyme-chlorinating species during the reaction of RebH with FADH2, Cl-, and O2. This species remains on the enzyme after removal of FAD and is fully competent to transfer chlorine to L-Trp in a second reaction forming 7-chlorotryptophan product. Neither product formation nor 36Cl labeling of the enzyme was detected in control reactions when RebH was initially reacted with oxidized FAD (Figure 1B, lane 2, and Figure 1C, trace 1). The enzyme variants, K79A (Figure 1B, lane 4, and Figure 1C, trace 4) and K79M (data not shown), were also inactive in both product formation and enzyme labeling assays. The species formed in the active site may be tightly bound or a covalent modification of the protein but is either released or labile upon denaturation of the enzyme.",
        "Product formation and 36Cl labeling assays also indicate formation of a stable chlorinating species in the flavin-dependent halogenase PltA, which catalyzes the dichlorina-tion of a pyrrole ring presented on a carrier protein scaffold during biosynthesis of pyoluteorin (21) (see Supporting Information, Figure 1). Curiously, PltM, another halogenase found in the pyoluteorin gene cluster but whose function in the biosynthetic pathway is unknown, also reacts with FADH2, [36Cl]NaCl, and O2 to form the enzyme containing the 36Cl label. Because of the difficulty of accessing substrate in this system and lack of kinetic information, we did not carry out further characterization of the chlorinating species in these enzymes. However, the identity of the intermediate is likely the same as in RebH.",
        "Table 1: Data Collection and Refinement Statistics (Molecular",
        "Stability of the Chlorinating Species in the ActiVe Site. During experiments to detect the chlorinating species in RebH, we noted above that the species was sufficiently stable to allow isolation of the enzyme and incubation at 25 \u00b0C before carrying out the substrate chlorination reaction. The half-life of decay of the chlorinating species was determined by monitoring its substrate chlorination activity from 0 to 288 h following its formation. Loss of substrate-chlorinating activity was attributed to decay of the species in the active site. This analysis showed that the chlorinating species is remarkably long-lived with t1/2 of 63 h at 4 \u00b0C and 28 h at 25 \u00b0C (Figure 2A). The stability of the enzyme-associated intermediate suggests that, once formed, it can remain in the active site for an extended time until substrate becomes available for reaction. RebH can also catalyze bromination of tryptophan by substituting Cl-with Br-when NaBr is present in solution (4). The t1/2 of the corresponding brominating species was approximately 60 min at 4 \u00b0C. The brominating species may have lower intrinsic chemical stability. Alternatively, the active site may not be as well-suited for protection of the brominated analogue.",
        "I-was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the RebH reaction in steady-state assays (see Supporting Information, Figure 2). In particular, I-completely inhibits formation of the chlorinating species when present in solution during flavin reactions. The addition of I-after flavin reactions also increased the rate of decay of the chlorinating species by >200-fold such that complete loss of activity was noted within 20 min of NaI treatment (see Supporting Information, Figure 2). Thus, I-is able to access and eliminate the species in the active site once it is formed.",
        "Kinetic Characterization of a Reaction Intermediate. The activity of the detected enzyme-chlorinating species to form the 7-chlorotryptophan product suggests that it is a critical intermediate in the enzymatic mechanism, rather than the product of an off-pathway side reaction. We determined the product formation rate for the active site chlorinating species to establish its kinetic competence as a reaction intermediate. RebH was first reacted with FADH2, Cl-, and O2 to isolate enzyme with the chlorinating species preformed in the active site. L-[14C]Trp was then added to the isolated enzyme sample, and the reaction was quenched at time points from 0 to 1800 s. The rate of 7-chlorotryptophan formation by the enzyme-chlorinating species was 0.29 s-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.17 s-1 at 4 \u00b0C (Figure 2B).",
        "These rates were compared with those obtained previously for the RebH reaction, specifically those for flavin reactions generating HOCl and overall product formation (2) (Figure 2C). In the reaction in which RebH is reacted with FADH2, Cl-, O2, and tryptophan, the rate of 7-chlorotryptophan formation was 0.05 s-1 at 25 \u00b0C (0.009 s-1 at 4 \u00b0C). This overall reaction rate corresponds to the steady-state kcat value and the rate-determining slow step in the mechanism (2, 4). Any individual step in the mechanism (and any intermediate that catalyzes this step) must proceed at a rate equal to or faster than this slowest rate. The detected chlorinating species in RebH catalyzes product formation at a rate significantly faster than in the overall reaction (6-fold increase at 25 \u00b0C and 20-fold increase at 4 \u00b0C) and, therefore, is a kinetically competent intermediate on the RebH reaction pathway. Indeed, it likely represents the proximal chlorinating agent in the active site which reacts directly with the substrate.",
        "FIGURE 1: Detection of a stable chlorinating intermediate in RebH. (A) Formation of 7-chlorotryptophan by RebH as the initial step in",
        "Furthermore, the observation that both flavin reactions forming HOCl and product formation by the chlorinating intermediate are fast implies that the rate-determining step in the reaction is likely to be the formation of this chlorinat-ing intermediate.",
        "Central Position of an ActiVe Site Lysine. We solved the structure of apo-RebH and of enzyme with bound FAD or tryptophan to obtain structural evidence for the identity of the chlorinating intermediate formed in the RebH active site. The structure of PrnA, which shares 55% sequence identity with RebH, was previously determined (1). As expected, in the overall fold and binding of flavin and tryptophan, RebH closely resembles PrnA with an rmsd of 0.99 \u00c5 for superimposition of the R carbons of 483 residues (see Supporting Information, Figure 3). Though we were unable to obtain a structure of the enzyme containing the actual chlorinating intermediate, the apo, tryptophan-bound, and flavin-bound RebH structures were evaluated in light of the new evidence for formation of a stable chlorinating inter-mediate in the active site.",
        "A key finding from the structure of halogenase PrnA was that flavin and tryptophan are separated by over 10 \u00c5 in the active site (1). It was concluded that HOCl generated in the flavin binding site would have to traverse this distance in order to catalyze the chlorination of tryptophan. Residue K79 in PrnA was highlighted as having a potential role in orientation of HOCl within the active site. We were also intrigued by the key position of K79 in the RebH structure (corresponding to the same residue in PrnA). In both PrnA and RebH, K79 is located directly between the flavin and tryptophan binding sites. Using the program CASTp3 and a standard probe size of 1.4 \u00c5, we searched for cavities in the tryptophan-bound RebH structure. This analysis showed that flavin and tryptophan bind in two separate cavities and that there is no open pathway between the two binding sites (Figure 3a). In fact, it would appear that HOCl generated in the flavin binding site would first encounter K79 before it could access the Trp binding pocket. In studies of protein oxidation, HOCl reacts readily with the NoneNH2 of lysine (k ) 7900 M-1 s-1) to form a stable chloramine, Lys-NoneNH-Cl (5, 6). Notably, the side chain of K79 is ordered, and its position and interactions are conserved in all of the structures solved thus far of RebH and PrnA. In both enzymes, K79 sits just 4.1 \u00c5 from C7 of tryptophan and forms a tight hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl of S347 (Figure 3b and Supporting Information, Figure 4). This interaction may be critical to the overall structure of the enzyme, as RebH K79A and K79M variants are affected in flavin oxidation reactions as well as overall halogenation activity (data not shown). Therefore, residue K79 occupies a key position in the RebH (and PrnA) active site and is a potential site for covalent modification by HOCl.",

        "molecule, HOCl, in the active site to carry out the chlorina-tion reaction. Since the form of the enzyme that contains the chlorinating intermediate does not require either bound FAD or L-Trp, we compared the structure of apo-RebH to that of PrnA containing both FAD and tryptophan to assess the potential for a small-molecule binding pocket in the apoenzyme. Notably, when flavin and tryptophan binding sites are unoccupied, the active site becomes exposed to solvent. A loop comprised of residues 40-49 is shifted 6 \u00c5 away from the opening of the flavin binding site, allowing solvent access to the entire flavin binding pocket (Figure 3c and Supporting Information, Figure 3). Residues 468-475 also become disordered, allowing both substrate and solvent access to the tryptophan binding site (see Supporting Information, Figure 3). Thus, in the active site of the apo-RebH structure, we were unable to identify a binding pocket that could protect a small-molecule intermediate, particularly one as reactive as HOCl. Moreover, addition of tryptophan to the FAD-bound enzyme also causes FAD to become disordered, so that the flavin binding site becomes exposed when substrate is in position to react. Lacking a covalent attachment, the available structures suggest that it would be exceedingly difficult to retain a chlorinating agent in the active site.",
        "DISCUSSION",
        "HOCl generated from capture of FAD(C4a)-OOH by Cl-during flavin redox reactions (1, 2) was previously proposed to function as the chlorinating agent that reacts directly with bound substrate during the halogenase reaction (1) (Scheme 1). This mechanism now appears unlikely given the remark-able stability of the enzyme-bound chlorinating intermediate detected in RebH (t1/2 ) 63 h or 2.6 days at 4 \u00b0C). It seems highly improbable that HOCl could be sequestered within the active site for such an extended time (up to 2 days) to prevent its diffusion away from the enzyme and reaction with other biological molecules. In the RebH structure and previously reported PrnA structure (1), no binding site for protection of such a reactive intermediate could be identified. In fact, the RebH active site becomes relatively exposed to solvent when flavin and tryptophan are absent. The ability of I-to access the chlorinating intermediate in RebH and accelerate its decomposition also suggests that the active site which contains this intermediate is solvent-accessible and unlikely to harbor a noncovalently associated, reactive small molecule.",
        "Rather, the RebH structure and closely related PrnA structure (1) show Lys79 located between the binding pockets for FAD and tryptophan in the active site. In this arrange-ment, HOCl generated from flavin redox reactions would encounter this lysine residue before reaching the substrate tryptophan. We propose that HOCl reacts with the active site lysine to form a stable chloramine. Indeed, the stability of the detected active site chlorinating species (t1/2 ) 28 h at 25 \u00b0C and 63 h at 4 \u00b0C) is consistent with that of Lys-NoneNH-Cl, which has t1/2 > 25 h at 37 \u00b0C (5, 22). As a covalently bound lysine chloramine, the chlorinating inter-mediate can be tethered via the N-Cl bond in the active site for prolonged periods. Neither HOCl nor an enzyme chloramine is expected to be stable in the unfolded enzyme as both react readily with Met and Cys residues that become exposed upon protein denaturation. Similarly, both are decomposed upon reaction with I-.",
        "FIGURE 3: Structure of RebH. (a) The ribbon structure of RebH",
        "Unfortunately, attempts to characterize this intermediate by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry were unsuccessful. Although the apoenzyme crystallized in 2 days at 4 \u00b0C, crystallization of the intermediate form of the enzyme required 2 weeks, by which time all of the intermediate had decayed. Conformational dynamics which occur during the flavin reactions may also prevent in situ generation of the chlorinating intermediate, as it could not be detected in the crystal of the apoenzyme following soaking with FADH2. A distinct chemical shift change of the NoneC of lysine is associated with formation of free lysine chloramine, but we were unable to observe the same change by 13C-HSQC or direct 13C detection of enzyme containing lysine-specific labeling. The sensitivity by NMR may be limited by the large size of the enzyme, which likely exists as the dimer (120 kDa). Finally, the decay of the intermediate upon protein denaturation precluded proteolytic digestion and detection of modified protein fragments by mass spectrometry.",
        "Despite the lack of direct detection of the proposed enzyme chloramine intermediate, the biochemical and structural evidence presented herein provides a basis for proposal of the following mechanism with Lys-NoneNH-Cl as the proximal chlorinating agent. As shown in Scheme 2, HOCl is formed as a product of flavin-based redox reactions and reacts with the active site lysine to form Lys-NoneNH-Cl. In the RebH structure, the NoneN of Lys79 sits 4.1 \u00c5 away from C7 of tryptophan (1). Thus, a Lys79-NoneNH-Cl may be ideally oriented for delivering a Cl+ equivalent for electrophilic aromatic substitution of the indole ring at C7. A candidate lysine corresponding to Lys79 can be identified in other known flavin-dependent halogenases (see Supporting Infor-mation, Figure 5). Furthermore, a similar chlorinating species has also been detected in the halogenase PltA and PltM from pyoluteorin biosynthesis (21) (see Supporting Information, Figure 1). Hence, we anticipate that formation of an enzyme chloramine intermediate will be a common feature in the mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases.",
        "The available kinetic data for RebH suggest that formation of this chlorinating intermediate is the rate-limiting step (Figure 2C). Because the chemical reaction between HOCl and lysine to form Lys-NoneNH-Cl is fast (8), the slow rate could be attributed to protein conformational changes that occur upon formation of this covalent enzyme intermediate. Protein dynamics was already shown to be critical for formation of flavin intermediates in RebH (2), and structural changes in the enzyme following formation of the chlorinating inter-mediate are indicated by NMR studies (data not shown). Notably, the KD for tryptophan in the unreacted enzyme was >100 \u00b5M as determined by equilibrium dialysis and ultra-filtration (data not shown) despite a steady-state Km value of 2.0 \u00b5M (4). Structural changes following intermediate formation could increase the affinity of the enzyme (now in the reactive form) for the substrate. In this way, substrate tryptophan only binds to the enzyme once the chlorinating intermediate is formed and the active site is set up for the chlorination reaction, possibly to prevent inappropriate reaction of substrate with HOCl that is also generated in the active site.",
        "The sequence of reactions proposed in the halogenase active site has precedent in protein oxidation carried out by HOCl and its chloramine products during the inflammatory response. Myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl is released by neutrophils and macrophages as a chemical weapon against invading microbes, where oxidative damage to cellular proteins leads to cell death. In addition to direct rapid oxidation by HOCl, chloramine products formed from the reaction of HOCl with biological amines have been shown to be important secondary mediators of further oxidative reactions (23, 24). The relatively stable chloramines remain active long after the initial immune response and can also diffuse away from the local site to inflict oxidative damage. As oxidizing agents, chloramines are milder and more selective for their target (7, 23), since their reactivity can be influenced by local structure and environment. Following HOCl treatment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), formation of a chloramine on an adjacent lysine directs chlorination of a specific Tyr192 residue in HDL (25-27). Chlorination of a catalytic Tyr in D-amino acid oxidase also requires specific binding of D-amino acid chloramine but does not occur with L-amino acid derivatives (28, 29). In this biological setting, the stability and selectivity of chloramines distinguish them from more potent and indiscriminate HOCl.",
        "The conversion of HOCl to a covalent chloramine in the active site of flavin-dependent halogenases offers distinct advantages for carrying out the regiospecific halogenation of small molecules for natural product construction. First, the oxidative potential of reactive HOCl is stored in a long-lived chloramine intermediate that is primed to react upon availabilityofthesubstrate.Becausereactionswithmonochloram-ines RNHCl are typically 105 slower compared with HOCl (7-9), precise tuning of the reactivity of the chloramine intermediate must occur in the active site in order to provide the oxidative potential required for chlorination of substrates such as tryptophan. Both the protonated monochloramine RNH2Cl+ (pKa \u223c1.5) and dichloramine RNCl2 (stable at pH <5) are more reactive, though significant perturbation of the local protein environment would be required to stabilize these forms of the intermediate at physiologic pH (22, 30-32). Efficient delivery of a Cl+ equivalent may also be facilitated",

        "by presentation of the substrate in optimal orientation and van der Waals distance from the N-Cl bond. Second, covalent catalysis by a reactive modification on a protein side chain provides for substrate and regiospecificity essential to the reaction by facilitating the orientation of substrate to the chloramine. This precise arrangement may be especially important since C7 is not the most activated position for nucleophilic substitution on the indole ring. Orientation effects may also explain the regiospecificity of halogenases that chlorinate at C5 or C6, rather than C7 (33, 34). In contrast, perhydrolases and haloperoxidases that generate free HOCl lack the specificity required for utility in biosynthetic reactions (35-39). Detection of the long-lived chlorinating intermediate in the flavin-dependent halogenase mechanism suggests nature\u2019s ingenious solution to the chemical problem of controlling a reactive and potentially destructive oxidant, HOCl, for C-Cl bond construction.",
