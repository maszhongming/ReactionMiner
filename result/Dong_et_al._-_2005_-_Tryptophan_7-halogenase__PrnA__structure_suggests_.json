Naismith1* Chlorinated natural products include vancomycin and cryptophycin A. Their biosynthesis involves regioselective chlorination by flavin-dependent halo-genases. We report the structural characterization of tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA), which regioselectively chlorinates tryptophan. Tryptophan and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are separated by a 10 angstrom\u2013long tunnel and bound by distinct enzyme modules. The FAD module is conserved in halogenases and is related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. On the basis of biochemical studies, crystal structures, and by analogy with monooxy-genases, we predict that FADH2 reacts with O2 to make peroxyflavin, which is decomposed by Cl \u2013 . The resulting HOCl is guided through the tunnel to tryptophan, where it is activated to participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution. In addition to man-made chemicals, there are nearly 4000 chlorinated and brominated natu-ral products (1), including drugs such as vancomycin (2), rebeccamycin (3), and cryp-tophycin A (4). The de novo chemical syn-thesis of complex natural products is often too expensive or too difficult to be practical. Their production relies on fermentation, and intro-ducing diversity in such molecules requires protein engineering. This has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the biological regioselective halogen-ation mechanism. Metal-dependent haloperoxidases were once thought to catalyze all halogenation reactions in biology and fall into two classes. Both heme-iron-dependent enzymes (5) and vanadium-dependent enzymes (6) have been structurally characterized. Al-though different in structure, both form a metal-bound hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with halide ions to produce a metal-bound hypohalite ion. This ion dissociates from the metal as hypohalous acid (5, 6), where in solution it reacts with substrate. Such halogenation lacks regioselectivity and substrate specificity (7). Perhydrolases are now recognized not to be involved in halometabolite biosynthesis (8). A new halogenase was reported by Dairi et al. identifying the gene for the chlorinating enzyme in chlorotetracycline biosynthesis (9). The gene product showed no similarity to haloperoxidases. Studies of the anti-fungal compound pyrrolnitrin from Pseu-domonas fluorescens identified two related genes ( prnA and prnC ), coding for two halogenating enzymes (10) (fig. S1). Both contain a flavin binding site (9\u201313) and exhibit weak sequence homology to flavin-dependent monooxygenase enzymes (14). PrnA catalyzes the regioselective chlorina-tion of the 7 position of tryptophan (15). Turnover requires that FAD is reduced to FADH 2 (by flavin reductase) and that O 2 is present (11). Members of this halogenase superfamily have been identified in the biosynthetic pathways of the antibiotics balhimycin (16) and vancomycin (2), the antitumor agent rebeccamycin (3), and other halometabolites (7, 17\u201321). It is likely that regiospecific halogenation reactions carried out by bacteria are predominately catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases. To ac-count for the regioselectivity, two mecha-nisms have been proposed. In one, the substrate is oxidized to an epoxide, which is decomposed by a nucleophilic attack of Cl \u2013 (11). In the other, direct chlorination by a high-energy flavin hypochlorite intermedi-ate occurs (22, 23). The use of HOCl as the halogenating agent has been explicitly dis-counted because of its reactivity and regio-selectivity (11, 23). PrnA was purified from a P. fluorescens expression system, and its structure was de-termined to 1.95 ). The structure consists of residues 2 to 518 (Fig. 1A) and is a dimer (fig. S2A). Each monomer is a single domain, shaped like a box with a triangular pyramid stuck to one face (Fig. 1A). The box, which we identify as the FAD binding module, is dominated by two large b sheets (Fig. 1A). FAD is bound in a solvent-exposed groove adjacent to the large paral-lel b sheet (Fig. 1A). The C4-N5 edge of the isoalloxazine ring sits above one face of the mainly antiparallel b sheet (Fig. 1, A and B). Sequence alignment shows that only the flavin binding module is con-served in flavin-dependent halogenases (fig. S3). Conserved residues map to this module, and some of these residues are con-served in the monooxygenase enzymes (fig. S3). The flavin binding module of PrnA is structurally similar to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) (24), a monooxygenase (fig. S4). Cl \u2013 is bound in a pocket on one face of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 1B) and makes contacts with the amide nitrogen atoms of Thr348 (T348) and Gly349 (G349) (25). No other Cl \u2013 is experimentally located despite the presence of 50 mM NaCl, and we identify this as the Cl \u2013 binding site. The amide backbone is known to bind negative ions and is proposed to bind F \u2013 ion in the fluorinase structure (26). Com-plexes with tryptophan and 7-chlorotryptophan were obtained by incubating the protein, before 1Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, EaStchem, Uni-versity of St. Andrews, St. Andrews KY16 9ST, UK. 2Institut fu\u0308r Biochemie, Technische Universita\u0308t Dres-den, D-01062 Dresden, Germany. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Tryptophan (Fig. 1C) and 7-chlorotryptophan (fig. S5B) are bound by the pyramid, which we denote as the substrate binding module (Fig. 1A). The protein structures are similar, with the com-pounds bound in an essentially identical manner. The discussion focuses on the higher resolution tryptophan complex. There is no substantial change in the protein structure upon tryptophan binding; the most notable difference is increased disorder in the loop between b2 and a2 at G48, adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring (fig. S5C). FAD and Cl \u2013 are bound at the same positions as in the native enzyme. One face of the tryptophan ring stacks against H101 and W455 (25), the other face against F103 (Fig. 1C). The indole nitrogen is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of E346. The amino group of tryptophan makes a salt link with E450 and hydrogen bonds to other residues. The car-boxylate group is also hydrogen bonded to the protein (Fig. 1C). We have obtained an FADH 2 structure by reducing the enzyme with dithionite. The crystals, obtained in the absence of Cl \u2013 , have an empty Cl \u2013 binding site. The isoalloxazine ring is bent and slightly changes its interaction with surrounding resi-dues (fig. S5, C and D). The loop at G48 undergoes a conformational change, and the helices capping the tryptophan binding site become disordered (fig. S5C). Together with the observation that in substrate and product complexes the G48 loop is less well ordered, it suggests there is communication between the modules regulating the enzyme. The mechanism of flavin-dependent mono-oxygenases is well established (27, 28). These enzymes are reduced to give FADH 2 , which then binds molecular oxygen to form a spec-troscopically characterized highly reactive peroxide-linked flavin (27, 28). This in-termediate is decomposed by the nucleo-philic attack of an adjacent phenolate substrate, resulting in oxygen atom transfer. Consistent with this established mechanism (27, 28), we and others (11, 23) propose that in PrnA FADH 2 binds O 2 , forming the same peroxide-linked isoalloxazine ring (Scheme 1). There is no moiety in PrnA that appears capable of binding or interact-ing with O 2 other than FADH 2 . In PrnA un-like PHBH, there is no room for an organic molecule to bind adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring, and the substrate is 10 ) distant. We see no indication of a large conformation change that could bring tryptophan and flavin together. Furthermore, the Cl \u2013 ion binding site is over 10 ) from 7-chlorotrytophan and no other Cl \u2013 binding site has been located. These observations seem to disfavor mecha-nisms involving direct transformation of substrate by oxygen linked to flavin (11) or flavin hypochlorite (22, 23). We cannot en-tirely eliminate these mechanisms because large conformational changes could take place. However, we postulate that the chlo-rinating agent created from flavin peroxide moves 10 ) to the tryptophan. In PrnA, Cl\u2013 is bound on the opposite face of FAD from the solvent and near to the entrance of the tunnel leading to the tryptophan (Fig. 1B). Cl \u2013 is positioned to make a nucleophilic attack on the flavin peroxide, resulting in the formation of hydroxylated FAD and Fig. 1.

The formation of HOCl from peroxides is well known in chemistry. Close to the expected site of this reaction, a water molecule is hydrogen bounded to S347 (Fig. 1B). PrnA incubated with 5-methylindole results in the formation of 3-chloro-5-methylindole (29) (fig. S6). We have established that, in so-lution, the substrate mimic 5-methylindole re-acts with HOCl to give 3-chloro-5-methylindole (fig. S7). In order to confirm the enzyme re-action was not due to adventitious HOCl production, we tested PrnA for its ability to chlorinate monochlorodimedone (MCD). MCD, which is much more reactive than 5-methylindole, is chlorinated by free HOCl and is used to assay haloperoxidases (5, 30) (fig. S6). MCD does not inhibit and is not chlorinated by PrnA (fig. S8), indicating that MCD does not access the tryptophan binding site. It establishes that production of 3-chloro-5-methylindole by enzyme does not arise from the presence of HOCl in solution. 5-Methylindole inhibits PrnA, consistent with it accessing the tryptophan binding site. The chlorinating agent at the tryptophan site has identical reactivity to that of HOCl (with respect to 5-methylindole). These data are consistent with the proposal that HOCl is created and channeled by PrnA. Modeling suggests PrnA binds 5-methylindole orienting its 3 position toward the tunnel (fig. S9). We propose HOCl is generated by the conserved flavin binding module and is there-fore general to all flavin-dependent halo-genases, irrespective of substrate or halogen (Cl or Br). The 10 ) tunnel is lined by the polypeptide main chain and the side chains of residues I82, K79, I52, and S347 (25) (Fig. 2A). These would not be oxidized or chlorinated by HOCl. W272 and W274 are remote from the site of HOCl formation, and, in any event, on its own tryptophan is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). We suggest that HOCl, after formation, is prevented from diffusing into solvent by the protein structure and instead enters this tunnel, moving toward tryptophan. In the native PrnA structure, K79 makes a hydrogen bond with a water molecule located at the end of the tunnel adjacent to the Cl atom of 7-chlorotryptophan (Fig. 2A). K79 may hydro-gen bond to HOCl and thus position it to react with tryptophan. In the absence of this water molecule, there is a cavity centered on the 7 position of tryptophan (Fig. 2A). We propose the basis for regioselective halogen-ation is the controlled spatial presentation of HOCl to substrate. There is a chemical precedent for this; in solution HOCl reacts with anisole resulting in p-and o-substitu-tion. By first adding cyclodextrin, which is thought to wrap around anisole masking the o-positions, it has been shown that only p-substitution occurs (31). Electrophilic addition of chlorine to trypto-phan proceeds through aWheland intermediate (Fig. 2B). This intermediate would be stabi-lized by interaction with E346, reminiscent of but reversed in polarity from p cation in-teractions (32, 33). E346 is positioned to de-protonate the intermediate, leading to product (Fig. 2, A and B). Tryptophan is less reactive than other aromatics and in solution is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). A more electro-philic source of Cl than HOCl is known to be required (23). If K79 does hydrogen bond to HOCl, it would activate Cl by increasing its electrophilicity (Fig. 2B), allowing it to chlo-rinate tryptophan. Such a spatially constrained activating step may not only accomplish halo-genation of less reactive substrates but could protect nearby tryptophan residues. In our assay, the native enzyme has a low k cat of 0.1 minj1 (fig. S10); however, rebeccamycin halo-genase is also slow with a k cat of 1.4 minj1 (23). We find no detectable activity for a K79YA79mutant, consistent with K79 playing a key role in guiding and activating HOCl. The k cat for PrnA E346Q (an E346YQ346 mu-tant) is decreased by about two orders of magnitude; K M is unchanged (fig. S11). This supports our proposed role for E346 (Fig. 2B) in stabilization and deprotonation of the intermediate. Halogenation using HOCl is well known in nature and organic chemistry, yet it lacks the reactivity and regioselectivity required for biosynthetic pathways. We suggest that with halogenases biology has evolved a remarkable mechanism of generat-ing, activating, and controlling HOCl. References and Notes 1. G. W. Gribble, Chemosphere 52, 289 (2003). 2. D.

Johnson,2 Louise Prakash,2 Satya Prakash,2 Aneel K. Aggarwal1* The Rev1 DNA polymerase is highly specialized for the incorporation of C op-posite template G. We present here the crystal structure of yeast Rev1 bound to template G and incoming 2\u00b6-deoxycytidine 5\u00b6-triphosphate (dCTP), which reveals that the polymerase itself dictates the identity of the incoming nucleo-tide, as well as the identity of the templating base. Template G and incoming dCTP do not pair with each other. Instead, the template G is evicted from the DNA helix, and it makes optimal hydrogen bonds with a segment of Rev1. Also, unlike other DNA polymerases, incoming dCTP pairs with an arginine rather than the templating base, which ensures the incorporation of dCTP over other in-coming nucleotides. This mechanism provides an elegant means for promoting proficient and error-free synthesis through N2-adducted guanines that obstruct replication. Rev1, a member of the eukaryotic Y family DNA polymerases, is highly specific for in-corporating a C opposite template G (1, 2). In this respect, Rev1 differs not only from the replicative and repair polymerases (Pols), which incorporate the correct nucleotide op-posite all four template bases with nearly equivalent catalytic efficiencies, but it differs Fig. 1.

        "for Regioselective Chlorination Changjiang Dong,1 Silvana Flecks,2 Susanne Unversucht,2 Caroline Haupt,2 Karl-Heinz van Pe\u0301e,2 James H. Naismith1* Chlorinated natural products include vancomycin and cryptophycin A. Their biosynthesis involves regioselective chlorination by flavin-dependent halo-genases. We report the structural characterization of tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA), which regioselectively chlorinates tryptophan. Tryptophan and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are separated by a 10 angstrom\u2013long tunnel and bound by distinct enzyme modules. The FAD module is conserved in halogenases and is related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. On the basis of biochemical studies, crystal structures, and by analogy with monooxy-genases, we predict that FADH2 reacts with O2 to make peroxyflavin, which is decomposed by Cl \u2013 . The resulting HOCl is guided through the tunnel to tryptophan, where it is activated to participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution.",
        "In addition to man-made chemicals, there are nearly 4000 chlorinated and brominated natu-ral products (1), including drugs such as vancomycin (2), rebeccamycin (3), and cryp-tophycin A (4). The de novo chemical syn-thesis of complex natural products is often too expensive or too difficult to be practical. Their production relies on fermentation, and intro-ducing diversity in such molecules requires protein engineering. This has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the biological regioselective halogen-ation mechanism. Metal-dependent haloperoxidases were once thought to catalyze all halogenation reactions in biology and fall into two classes. Both heme-iron-dependent enzymes (5) and vanadium-dependent enzymes (6) have been structurally characterized. Al-though different in structure, both form a metal-bound hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with halide ions to produce a metal-bound hypohalite ion. This ion dissociates from the metal as hypohalous acid (5, 6), where in solution it reacts with substrate. Such halogenation lacks regioselectivity and substrate specificity (7). Perhydrolases are now recognized not to be involved in halometabolite biosynthesis (8). A new halogenase was reported by Dairi et al. identifying the gene for the chlorinating enzyme in chlorotetracycline biosynthesis (9). The gene product showed no similarity to haloperoxidases. Studies of the anti-fungal compound pyrrolnitrin from Pseu-",
        "domonas fluorescens identified two related genes ( prnA and prnC ), coding for two halogenating enzymes (10) (fig. S1). Both contain a flavin binding site (9\u201313) and exhibit weak sequence homology to flavin-dependent monooxygenase enzymes (14). PrnA catalyzes the regioselective chlorina-tion of the 7 position of tryptophan (15). Turnover requires that FAD is reduced to FADH 2 (by flavin reductase) and that O 2 is present (11). Members of this halogenase superfamily have been identified in the biosynthetic pathways of the antibiotics balhimycin (16) and vancomycin (2), the antitumor agent rebeccamycin (3), and other halometabolites (7, 17\u201321). It is likely that regiospecific halogenation reactions carried out by bacteria are predominately catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases. To ac-count for the regioselectivity, two mecha-",
        "nisms have been proposed. In one, the substrate is oxidized to an epoxide, which is decomposed by a nucleophilic attack of Cl \u2013 (11). In the other, direct chlorination by a high-energy flavin hypochlorite intermedi-ate occurs (22, 23). The use of HOCl as the halogenating agent has been explicitly dis-counted because of its reactivity and regio-selectivity (11, 23).",
        "PrnA was purified from a P. fluorescens expression system, and its structure was de-termined to 1.95 ). The structure consists of residues 2 to 518 (Fig. 1A) and is a dimer (fig. S2A). Each monomer is a single domain, shaped like a box with a triangular pyramid stuck to one face (Fig. 1A). The box, which we identify as the FAD binding module, is dominated by two large b sheets (Fig. 1A). FAD is bound in a solvent-exposed groove adjacent to the large paral-lel b sheet (Fig. 1A). The C4-N5 edge of the isoalloxazine ring sits above one face of the mainly antiparallel b sheet (Fig. 1, A and B). Sequence alignment shows that only the flavin binding module is con-served in flavin-dependent halogenases (fig. S3). Conserved residues map to this module, and some of these residues are con-served in the monooxygenase enzymes (fig. S3). The flavin binding module of PrnA is structurally similar to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) (24), a monooxygenase (fig. S4).",
        "Cl \u2013 is bound in a pocket on one face of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 1B) and makes contacts with the amide nitrogen atoms of Thr348 (T348) and Gly349 (G349) (25). No other Cl \u2013 is experimentally located despite the presence of 50 mM NaCl, and we identify this as the Cl \u2013 binding site. The amide backbone is known to bind negative ions and is proposed to bind F \u2013 ion in the fluorinase structure (26). Com-plexes with tryptophan and 7-chlorotryptophan were obtained by incubating the protein, before",

The protein structures are similar, with the com-pounds bound in an essentially identical manner. The discussion focuses on the higher resolution tryptophan complex. There is no substantial change in the protein structure upon tryptophan binding; the most notable difference is increased disorder in the loop between b2 and a2 at G48, adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring (fig. S5C). FAD and Cl \u2013 are bound at the same positions as in the native enzyme. One face of the tryptophan ring stacks against H101 and W455 (25), the other face against F103 (Fig. 1C). The indole nitrogen is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of E346. The amino group of tryptophan makes a salt link with E450 and hydrogen bonds to other residues. The car-boxylate group is also hydrogen bonded to the protein (Fig. 1C). We have obtained an FADH 2 structure by reducing the enzyme with dithionite. The crystals, obtained in the",
        "absence of Cl \u2013 , have an empty Cl \u2013 binding site. The isoalloxazine ring is bent and slightly changes its interaction with surrounding resi-dues (fig. S5, C and D). The loop at G48 undergoes a conformational change, and the helices capping the tryptophan binding site become disordered (fig. S5C). Together with the observation that in substrate and product complexes the G48 loop is less well ordered, it suggests there is communication between the modules regulating the enzyme. The mechanism of flavin-dependent mono-oxygenases is well established (27, 28). These enzymes are reduced to give FADH 2 , which then binds molecular oxygen to form a spec-troscopically characterized highly reactive peroxide-linked flavin (27, 28). This in-termediate is decomposed by the nucleo-philic attack of an adjacent phenolate substrate, resulting in oxygen atom transfer. Consistent with this established mechanism (27, 28), we and others (11, 23) propose that in PrnA FADH 2 binds O 2 , forming the same peroxide-linked isoalloxazine ring (Scheme 1). There is no moiety in PrnA",
        "that appears capable of binding or interact-ing with O 2 other than FADH 2 . In PrnA un-like PHBH, there is no room for an organic molecule to bind adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring, and the substrate is 10 ) distant. We see no indication of a large conformation change that could bring tryptophan and flavin together. Furthermore, the Cl \u2013 ion binding site is over 10 ) from 7-chlorotrytophan and no other Cl \u2013 binding site has been located. These observations seem to disfavor mecha-nisms involving direct transformation of substrate by oxygen linked to flavin (11) or flavin hypochlorite (22, 23). We cannot en-tirely eliminate these mechanisms because large conformational changes could take place. However, we postulate that the chlo-rinating agent created from flavin peroxide moves 10 ) to the tryptophan. In PrnA, Cl\u2013 is bound on the opposite face of FAD from the solvent and near to the entrance of the tunnel leading to the tryptophan (Fig. 1B). Cl \u2013 is positioned to make a nucleophilic attack on the flavin peroxide, resulting in the formation of hydroxylated FAD and",

        "HOCl (Scheme 1). The formation of HOCl from peroxides is well known in chemistry. Close to the expected site of this reaction, a water molecule is hydrogen bounded to S347 (Fig. 1B). PrnA incubated with 5-methylindole results in the formation of 3-chloro-5-methylindole (29) (fig. S6). We have established that, in so-lution, the substrate mimic 5-methylindole re-acts with HOCl to give 3-chloro-5-methylindole (fig. S7). In order to confirm the enzyme re-action was not due to adventitious HOCl production, we tested PrnA for its ability to chlorinate monochlorodimedone (MCD). MCD, which is much more reactive than 5-methylindole, is chlorinated by free HOCl and is used to assay haloperoxidases (5, 30) (fig. S6). MCD does not inhibit and is not chlorinated by PrnA (fig. S8), indicating that MCD does not access the tryptophan binding site. It establishes that production",
        "of 3-chloro-5-methylindole by enzyme does not arise from the presence of HOCl in solution. 5-Methylindole inhibits PrnA, consistent with it accessing the tryptophan binding site. The chlorinating agent at the tryptophan site has identical reactivity to that of HOCl (with respect to 5-methylindole). These data are consistent with the proposal that HOCl is created and channeled by PrnA. Modeling suggests PrnA binds 5-methylindole orienting its 3 position toward the tunnel (fig. S9). We propose HOCl is generated by the conserved flavin binding module and is there-fore general to all flavin-dependent halo-genases, irrespective of substrate or halogen (Cl or Br). The 10 ) tunnel is lined by the polypeptide main chain and the side chains of residues I82, K79, I52, and S347 (25) (Fig. 2A). These would not be oxidized or chlorinated by HOCl. W272 and W274 are remote from the",
        "site of HOCl formation, and, in any event, on its own tryptophan is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). We suggest that HOCl, after formation, is prevented from diffusing into solvent by the protein structure and instead enters this tunnel, moving toward tryptophan. In the native PrnA structure, K79 makes a hydrogen bond with a water molecule located at the end of the tunnel adjacent to the Cl atom of 7-chlorotryptophan (Fig. 2A). K79 may hydro-gen bond to HOCl and thus position it to react with tryptophan. In the absence of this water molecule, there is a cavity centered on the 7 position of tryptophan (Fig. 2A). We propose the basis for regioselective halogen-ation is the controlled spatial presentation of HOCl to substrate. There is a chemical precedent for this; in solution HOCl reacts with anisole resulting in p-and o-substitu-tion. By first adding cyclodextrin, which is thought to wrap around anisole masking the o-positions, it has been shown that only p-substitution occurs (31).",
        "Electrophilic addition of chlorine to trypto-phan proceeds through aWheland intermediate (Fig. 2B). This intermediate would be stabi-lized by interaction with E346, reminiscent of but reversed in polarity from p cation in-teractions (32, 33). E346 is positioned to de-protonate the intermediate, leading to product (Fig. 2, A and B). Tryptophan is less reactive than other aromatics and in solution is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). A more electro-philic source of Cl than HOCl is known to be required (23). If K79 does hydrogen bond to HOCl, it would activate Cl by increasing its electrophilicity (Fig. 2B), allowing it to chlo-rinate tryptophan. Such a spatially constrained activating step may not only accomplish halo-genation of less reactive substrates but could protect nearby tryptophan residues. In our assay, the native enzyme has a low k cat of 0.1 minj1 (fig. S10); however, rebeccamycin halo-genase is also slow with a k cat of 1.4 minj1 (23). We find no detectable activity for a K79YA79mutant, consistent with K79 playing a key role in guiding and activating HOCl. The k cat for PrnA E346Q (an E346YQ346 mu-tant) is decreased by about two orders of magnitude; K M is unchanged (fig. S11). This supports our proposed role for E346 (Fig. 2B) in stabilization and deprotonation of the intermediate. Halogenation using HOCl is well known in nature and organic chemistry, yet it lacks the reactivity and regioselectivity required for biosynthetic pathways. We suggest that with halogenases biology has evolved a remarkable mechanism of generat-ing, activating, and controlling HOCl.",

Template G and incoming dCTP do not pair with each other. Instead, the template G is evicted from the DNA helix, and it makes optimal hydrogen bonds with a segment of Rev1.
